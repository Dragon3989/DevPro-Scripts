# DevPro-Scripts
This is what is used when watching replays, vsing devbot, otherwise it's managed by the server.
To install/add these files simply find your DevPro folder. If you don't know where that is right click on your devpro shortcut.
From there you can either right click on the zip you downloaded and extract it to that folder. Or open the zip and copy the
"Scripts" folder from inside this and paste it there.
